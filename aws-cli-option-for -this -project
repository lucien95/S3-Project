In a previous role, I was tasked with securely archiving critical business data for long-term retention. I implemented an AWS S3 storage solution to store this data cost-effectively and securely. To enhance data security, I configured versioning and cross-region replication, ensuring data durability and disaster recovery capabilities. Additionally, I utilized S3 lifecycle policies to automate the transition of older data to lower-cost storage classes like S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. This not only saved costs but also ensured compliance with data retention policies.

your end goal in this scenario is to create a secure, cost-effective, and compliant data archiving solution using AWS S3 that ensures long-term data retention and disaster recovery capabilities.

COMMON AWS CLI COMMANDS FOR S3.

- To enable versioning on your bucket. Replace Enabled with Suspended ---> suspended Will disable the versioning or stop versioning.--->

$ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <BUCKET-NAME> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

- To see the different versions in a bucket---->
$ aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <BUCKET-NAME>

1. Create an IAM Role. call it "REPLICATIONROLE"

aws iam create-role --role-name ReplicationRole --assume-role-policy-document '{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}'


2. Now Create a Permission policy and attach to the role above.Called it "REPLICATIONPOLICY"

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name ReplicationRole --policy-name ReplicationPolicy --policy-document '{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
        "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
        "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<SOURCE-BUCKET-NAME>/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<DESTINATION-BUCKET-NAME>/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ReplicateObject",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<DESTINATION-BUCKET-NAME>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}'



3. Configure the cross region replication.

aws s3api put-bucket-replication --bucket my-tf-pipelinebucket2023 --replication-configuration'{
    "Role": "arn:aws:iam::034086922645:role/ReplicationRole",
    "Rules": [
        {
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Destination": {
                "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::<DESTINATION-BUCKET-NAME>",
                "StorageClass": "STANDARD"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
